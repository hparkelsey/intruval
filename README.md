Created a dynamic spreadsheet model to determine the relative implied share prices of the top 100 equities of the S&P 500, by analyzing market multiples, price-to-earnings ratios, earnings-per-share, and other summary performance metrics.

Utilized the pandas_datareader sub-package to pull stock data from Yahoo Finance and output to a spreadsheet using Sheets API, and determined whether a stock was overpriced or underpriced with actionable recommendations.
